# Making "paired" free energy plots

Here's a brief tutorial on making "paired" free energy plots, like so:

![GH29 paired plot](../plots/GH29.png)

This approach uses `ggplot2`, which requires (or at least strongly prefers) data in the "long" format. Each row should contain a single observation (in this case, a single enzyme) and each column should contain a variable. 

However, we want to link pairs of enzymes, so those enzymes will need a variable that is the same for each member of a pair (but different for each set of pairs). 

## Loading data from binary

I've stored the data as a binary `.rds` file. Note that the working directory for this notebook is `reports/`, so we have to go up a directory to get to `data/`. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse, verbose=FALSE)
theme_set(theme_classic()) # sets a graphical theme
GH29 <- readRDS("../data/GH29_paired_homologs.rds") #
```

Let's take a look at the structure of this data frame (or [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), to be precise:

```{r}
glimpse(GH29)
```
The relevant columns here are `total_energy`, `depth`, `DDG`, and `paired`. 
This data frame is in "long" format: each row contains data about one enzyme, and each column contains one variable describing enzymes. `glimpse()` shows data frames sideways, so that "columns" are horizontal. The structure is a little easier to understand with `head()`:

```{r}
head(GH29)
```


# Building the plot piece by piece

Let's build up this plot piece by piece;

```{r}
p <- ggplot(GH29, aes(x=depth, y=total_energy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point() 
print(p)
```
This is basically what we want, but we need a way to connect pairs of dots.

We're using `paired` here as a common identifier for pairs of enzymes. I think they are the accession number for the protein in the deep sediment. The point is that each value of `paired` occurrs exactly twice the data set. We'll use `geom_line()` to create lines between pairs of points, and we'll use `group()` inside `aes()` to show *which* lines need to be connected. 

```{r}
p <- p + 
  geom_line(aes(group=paired))
print(p)
```
The lines are connected! All we need to do is to color them by whether they're more negative in deep sediment or surface sediment. 

# Writing functions for plots

It would also be a good idea to wrap this plot in a function. I know we're going to make a lot of these plots, so it is safer and faster to use a single function. 

```{r}
ddg_plot <- function(df) {
  p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=depth, y=total_energy)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    geom_point(aes(colour=DDG)) + 
    # alpha = 0.5 make the lines a 50% transparent, whcih looks a little nicer
    geom_line(aes(colour = DDG, group = paired), alpha = 0.5) +
    scale_color_manual(name=NULL, values=c("#517C96", "#8D2048")) +
    # For more information on using math-like symbols in R plots,
    # type demo(plotmath)
    ylab(expression(paste("free energy of folding, kJ ", mol^{-1})))
  p
}
ddg_plot(GH29)
```
Beautiful. The colors, by the way, are "tertiary" colors of the official UT color scheme. They're semi-secret, but I'll give them to you if you ask :)

# Adding options

Finally, I probably want the option to change this plot around, e.g. using different colors for different presentations. So, instead of "hard-coding" the colors, axis labels, etc, let's pass them in as parameters, with sensible default values. 

```{r}
ddg_plot <- function(df, 
                     with.lines=TRUE,
                     title=NULL, 
                     colors=c("#517C96", "#8D2048"), 
                     ylab=expression(paste("free energy of folding, kJ ", mol^{-1})), 
                     legend.pos="none", 
                     theme=theme_classic(),
                     text.size=NULL) {
  p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=depth, y=total_energy)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    geom_point(aes(colour=DDG)) 
  
  if(with.lines) {
    p <- p + geom_point(aes(colour=DDG)) +
      geom_line(aes(x=depth, y=total_energy, colour = DDG, group = paired), alpha = 0.5) 
  }
  
  if(!is.null(title)) {
    p <- p + ggtitle(title)
  }
  if(!is.null(colors) & with.lines) {
    p <- p + scale_color_manual(name=NULL, values=colors)
  }
  if(!is.null(ylab)) {
    p <- p + scale_y_continuous(name=ylab)
  }
  if(!is.null(title)) {
    p <- p + ggtitle(title)
  }
  
  p <- p + theme
  
  if(!is.null(legend)) {
    p <- p + theme(legend.position=legend.pos)
  }
  
  if(!is.null(text.size)) {
    p <- p + theme(text = element_text(size=text.size))
  }
  p
}

p <- ddg_plot(GH29)
print(p)
```
One last important thing about saving plots in R: the `ggsave()` function allows you to set the actual dimensions of a saved plot (in inches, cm, pixels, or whatever). **You should always use this** when making plots for publication, posters, or powerpoint presentations. That way, you'll know what the final font size is, and you can be sure that the figures are the appropriate size for how you're using them. 

```{r}
ggsave(filename="../plots/GH29_plot.png", #
       #ggsave automatically saves the file in the format consistent with the filename
       plot=p, 
       height=3, 
       width=4, 
       units="in", # because I am a cultureless American :)
       dpi=300) 
```
